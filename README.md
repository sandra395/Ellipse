# Ellipse

Using p5.js

This code creates an interactive sketch using p5.js, where a circle (ellipse) is drawn following the mouse's position on the canvas. The appearance of the circle changes depending on whether the user is pressing the mouse button or not.

When the mouse is clicked: A large circle with a thick outline (25px) will be drawn where the mouse is, but it will have no fill.

When the mouse is not clicked: The circle is still drawn at the mouse position, but the outline thickness will remain at the default (thin), and it will have no fill.

The visual effect is an interactive sketch where the user can create circles with different outline thicknesses. When the mouse button is held down, the circles will have a bold, thick outline, and when the mouse button is released, the circles will have a default thin outline.
